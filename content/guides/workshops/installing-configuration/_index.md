MobiFlight workshops use a [Mega 2560 Pro Mini](/boards/recommended/mega-2560-pro-mini) board with a pre-defined device configuration. This configuration maps the devices to the appropriate pins for use with a [prototyping board v2](https://shop.mobiflight.com/product/prototyping-board-v2).

Use the following steps to upload the configuration to a board.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These steps assume the board already has the appropriate MobiFlight firmware installed. To install the firmware follow the [flashing guide](/guides/flashing-ambiguous-boards/).
