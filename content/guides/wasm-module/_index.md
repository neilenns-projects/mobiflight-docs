description: Guides to troubleshoot WASM module problems in MobiFlight.

The WASM module is the component MobiFlight uses to send and receive events from Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. If MobiFlight cannot communicate with it, a warning icon will be shown in the status bar at the bottom of the main window.

In most cases, this problem can be resolved by [reinstalling the module](/guides/wasm-module/wasm-reinstall/). For Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, also [verify the module is enabled](/guides/wasm-module/enable-in-msfs2024). If that fails the module can be [installed manually](/guides/wasm-module/wasm-manual-install/).
