[Reinstalling the WASM module](/guides/wasm-reinstall/) is the preferred method of installing the module. However, in some cases MobiFlight cannot determine the correct install location for the module. In that situation, the module can be manually installed into the flight simulator community folder.

## Find the community folder

The WASM module is installed in the flight simulator community folder. The method for determining its location depends on the version of Microsoft Flight Simulator.

### Enable developer mode

In flight simulator, select **Options** then **General options** from the main screen. Select the **Developers** category and set **Developer mode** to **On**.

### Locate the community folder

From the **Tools** menu, select **Virtual File System**. Expand the **Packages Folders** section in the dialog and click the **Open Community Folder** button.

## Install the WASM module

{{% steps %}}

### Close Microsoft Flight Simulator

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The simulator must be completely closed before installing the WASM module.

### Open the MobiFlight install folder

MobiFlight is installed in the `%localappdata%\MobiFlight\MobiFlight Connector\MSFS2020-module` folder. Open that location using File Explorer.

The same WASM module is used for both versions of Microsoft Flight Simulator even though the folder is named `MSFS2020-module`.

### Copy the module to the community folder

Use File Explorer to copy the `mobiflight-event-module` folder into the community folder location found in the previous section.

## Verify the installation

Launch Microsoft Flight Simulator and MobiFlight. Once the flight simulator loads to the main screen, MobiFlight will update to show the active simulator connection in the status bar.
