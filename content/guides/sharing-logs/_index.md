description: How to share logs from MobiFlight when requesting support.
---

MobiFlight logs make it easier for people to answer support questions in [Discord](https://discord.gg/yUaBqMbz). The following steps show how to enable and share logs from MobiFlight.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always share the complete log file using these steps when requested. Sharing partial logs, or screenshots of logs,
> delays support and makes it harder to resolve questions.

### Enable logging

Check the **enabled** checkbox in the **Logging** section.

### Set the log level

In many cases, the default **Info** log level is sufficient for troubleshooting. If the request was for debug logging, change the **Log Level** dropdown to **Debug**.

### Close settings

Click **OK** to close the dialog.

### Re-create the issue

With logging enabled, re-create the issue. Depending on the problem, this may include:

- Closing and running MobiFlight.
- Attempting to update the board firmware.
- Interacting with devices.
- Triggering events in the simulator.

### Copy the logs to the clipboard

After re-creating the issue, copy the logs to the clipboard by going to the **Extras** menu and selecting **Copy logs to clipboard**. A success dialog will show after the logs are copied.

### Paste the logs in Discord

Switch to Discord and click in the message box for the support thread, then press **CTRL+V** to paste the logs. Discord will automatically convert the logs to a text attachment.

> [!TIP]
> After the issue is resolved, disable logging by going to the **Settings** dialog and unchecking the **enabled** checkbox for **Logging**.
> Logging can slow MobiFlight down and should only be enabled when troubleshooting.
