The **MobiFlight - Virtual Joystick input (vJoy)** action type triggers a vJoy input, simulating a joystick input. This action type is typically used to interact with applications other than a flight simulator, for example to trigger push-to-talk in [vPilot](https://vpilot.rosscarlson.dev/) or [xPilot](https://docs.xpilot-project.org/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This action type requires vJoy. Many versions are available online, not all of which work with modern versions of Windows. The [BrunnerInnovation fork](https://github.com/BrunnerInnovation/vJoy) is known to work on both Windows 10 and Windows 11.
