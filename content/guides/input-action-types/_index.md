MobiFlight supports several different methods to map inputs to a flight simulator control. For Microsoft Flight Simulator, the [Microsoft Flight Simulator](/guides/input-action-types/microsoft-flight-simulator/) action type is the recommended method. For X-Plane, the [X-Plane (all versions)](/guides/input-action-types/x-plane-all-versions/) action type is recommended.

The other action types are useful for less common scenarios. See the individual action type pages for examples of where they are used.
