MobiFlight supports several different methods to map inputs to a flight simulator control. While there are many options available, the most commonly-used are:

- [Microsoft Flight Simulator](/guides/input-action-types/microsoft-flight-simulator/), for controlling aircraft in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024.
- [X-Plane (all versions)](/guides/input-action-types/x-plane-all-versions/), for controlling aircraft in all versions of X-Plane.
- [MobiFlight - Variable](/guides/input-action-types/mobiflight-variable), for setting variables used in configuration pre-conditions.

The other action types are only used in the specific situations, described on the associated reference page.
