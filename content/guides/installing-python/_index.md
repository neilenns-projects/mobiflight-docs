Python is the primary scripting language used by MobiFlight to connect custom aircraft APIs to [WinWing CDUs](/game-controllers/winwing/winwing-cdu/). The following must be installed for MobiFlight to work with Python:

- Python version `v3.11` or later.
- The `websockets`, `gql`, and `SimConnect` Python packages.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The command must be run from a **Command Prompt**, not from within Python.
>
> If the result of the command is `SyntaxError: invalid syntax`, it means it was run from within Python instead of a command prompt.

> [!TIP]
> If `pip` gives a warning about adding directories to PATH, you can safely ignore it.
