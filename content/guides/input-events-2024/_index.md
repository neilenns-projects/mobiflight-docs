Input events are the way to interact with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 from apps like MobiFlight. Also referred to as `Bvars`, they provide a defined way to trigger every cockpit interaction.

Input events for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 are documented in [HubHop](https://hubhop.mobiflight.com/) under each aircraft with `(2024)` appended to the end. For example, Cessna 172 input events are under the []`C172 (2024)`](https://hubhop.mobiflight.com/presets/?aircraft=C172+%282024%29) aircraft. Use the following steps to find input events that are not yet documented in HubHop.
