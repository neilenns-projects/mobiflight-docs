MobiFlight supports the WINWING FCU, MCDU, and PFP3N.

> [!TIP]
> WINWING devices are automatically shown in the input and output configuration dialogs. They will not appear in the **Modules** tab of the **Settings** dialog as they are not [boards](/boards/). To confirm the WINWING device is seen by MobiFlight, use the **Peripherals** tab of the **Settings** dialog.

## Troubleshooting

If the WINWING device does not appear in the **Peripherals** tab of the **Settings** dialog, make sure the joystick has the latest firmware installed, and that the SIMAPP PRO application isn't running. Also, try restarting MobiFlight: devices plugged in after MobiFlight is launched are not automatically detected.
