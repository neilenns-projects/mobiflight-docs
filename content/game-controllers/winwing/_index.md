MobiFlight supports the WINWING FCU, MCDU, and PFP 3N.

WINWING devices are automatically shown in the input and output configuration dialogs. They will not appear in the **Modules** tab of the **Settings** dialog as they are not [boards](/boards/).

The WINWING PFP 3N CDU display requires additional configuration and is only supported with specific aircraft. See the [WINWING CDU documentation](/game-controllers/winwing/winwing-cdu/) for more information.

> [!TIP]
> To confirm WINWING devices are seen by MobiFlight, use the **Peripherals** tab of the **Settings** dialog.

## Troubleshooting

If the WINWING device does not appear in the **Peripherals** tab of the **Settings** dialog, make sure the joystick has the latest firmware installed, and that the SIMAPP PRO application isn't running. Also, try restarting MobiFlight: devices plugged in after MobiFlight is launched are not automatically detected.
