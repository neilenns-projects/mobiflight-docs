The compare modifier changes a value based on a boolean logic test of the original value.

The value in the first text box defines what the original value is compared to. The second text box is the resulting value if the comparison is true. The third text box is the resulting value if the comparison is false.

[NCalc expressions](https://ncalc.github.io/ncalc/articles/index.html) are supported in all three boxes. The current value is represented by the **$** character.
