MobiFlight supports several different methods to map outputs from a flight simulator to an output device. The most commonly used are:

- [SimConnect (MSFS)](/features/output-variable-types/simconnect-msfs/), for displaying values from Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024.
- [X-Plane DataRef](/features/output-variable-types/x-plane-dataref/), for displaying values from all versions of X-Plane.

The other variable types are only used in the specific situations, described on the associated reference page.
