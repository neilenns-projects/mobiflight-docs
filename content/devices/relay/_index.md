> [!CAUTION]
> Relays often control AC mains voltage, which can cause serious injury or death if handled improperly. Always disconnect power before working on circuits, use proper insulation, and follow local electrical safety regulations.

Relays are commonly used to switch electrical circuits running at more than +5V. They take an `on` or `off` signal as input to switch higher voltage on and off.

To use relays with MobiFlight, follow the [LED guide](/devices/leds/) to configure them as outputs.

> [!TIP]
> Make sure to purchase 5V relays. Many listings include different variations, such as 12V, that will not work with [supported boards](/boards/).
