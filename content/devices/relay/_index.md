Relays are commonly used to switch electrical circuits running at more than +5V. They take an `on` or `off` signal as input to switch higher voltage on and off.

To use relays with MobiFlight follow the [LED guide](/devices/leds/) to configure them as outputs.

> [!TIP]
> Make sure to purchase 5V relays. Many listings include different variations, such as 12V, that will not work with [supported boards](/boards/).
