> [!CAUTION]
> Do not work with voltages over 24V unless you are familiar with electrical safety standards. AC mains voltage can cause serious injury or death if handled improperly. If you are unsure of how to work with AC mains voltage safely, consult a qualified electrician.

Relays are commonly used to switch electrical circuits running at more than +5V. They take an `on` or `off` signal as input to switch higher voltage on and off. For controlling LED strips with MobiFlight, use a [MOSFET](/devices/mosfet/) instead, as they provide the ability to dim the LEDs.

To use relays with MobiFlight, follow the [LED guide](/devices/leds/) to configure them as outputs. For information on how many relays can be connected to a board, see the [boards](/boards/) documentation and look at the LED limits.

> [!TIP]
> Make sure to purchase 5V relays. Many listings include different variations, such as 12V, that will not work with [supported boards](/boards/).
