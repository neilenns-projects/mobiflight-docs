> - Always disconnect power before working on circuits.
> - Use proper insulation.
> - Be familiar with, and follow, relevant electrical safety regulations.

> If you're unsure of how to work with AC mains voltage safely, consult a qualified electrician.

Relays are commonly used to switch electrical circuits running at more than +5V. They take an `on` or `off` signal as input to switch higher voltage on and off.
