> [!CAUTION]
> AC mains voltage can cause serious injury or death if handled improperly. Whenever possible, use relays to switch low-voltage circuits (24V or below) to reduce risk.
>
> - Always disconnect power before working on circuits.
> - Use proper insulation.
> - Be familiar with, and follow, relevant electrical safety regulations.

> If you are unsure of how to work with AC mains voltage safely, consult a qualified electrician.

Relays are commonly used to switch electrical circuits running at more than +5V. They take an `on` or `off` signal as input to switch higher voltage on and off.

To use relays with MobiFlight, follow the [LED guide](/devices/leds/) to configure them as outputs.

> [!TIP]
> Make sure to purchase 5V relays. Many listings include different variations, such as 12V, that will not work with [supported boards](/boards/).
