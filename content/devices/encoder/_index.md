## Popular options

The most popular encoders are based on the `EC11` design and include an integrated push button. Single encoders can be purchased as a bare encoder or with a breakout board attached.
Dual encoders are typically only available as a bare encoder, but can be purchased with a breakout board from the [MobiFlight Shop](https://shop.mobiflight.com/product/dual-encoder-bundle).
