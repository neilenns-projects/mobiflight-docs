> [!TIP]
> If the encoder has an integrated button, follow the [button guide](/devices/button-switch)
> to add the button after following this guide to add the encoder.
>
> If the encoder is a dual encoder, follow this guide twice: once for the inner
> encoder and a second time for the outer encoder.

### Configure the encoder

Use the **Pin settings** dropdown to specify the board pins for the left and right pins of the encoder.

Select the **Type** dropdown to specify the type of the encoder.

Provide a meaningful name for the encoder in the **Name** field. This name is shown in the input configuration screens when assigning the encoder to a flight simulator input.

> [!TIP]
> The encoder type usually isn't listed on the encoder datasheet.
> Start with **1 detent per cycle (11)** and see how well it works.
> If the encoder is missing steps when turned edit the device configuration and
> try the other three types until the encoder accurately responds to each step.

### Upload the changes to the board

Click the **Upload config** button at the bottom of the **MobiFlight Modules** tab to upload the modified
configuration to the board.
