## Popular options

### Toggle switches

Toggle switches come in many varieties, all of which are useful for cockpit building. Choices include:

{{< tabs items="ON-ON,(ON)-OFF,ON-OFF-ON,(ON)-OFF-ON,(ON)-OFF-(ON)" >}}

<!-- ON-ON -->

{{< tab >}}
The handle can be moved to either of two **ON** positions. They are often used for parking brake, light, and power switches. These switches use one input pin on a board, even though they have three pins on the switch.
{{< /tab >}}

<!-- (ON)-OFF -->

{{< tab >}}
The handle only stays in the **ON** position momentarily, as long as the switch is physically held in that position. When released, the switch goes back to the **OFF** position. These switches use one input pin on a board, even though they have three pins on the switch.
{{< /tab >}}

<!-- ON-OFF-ON -->

{{< tab >}}
The handle can be set to three different positions, **ON** at one side, **OFF** in the middle, and **ON** at the other side. They are often used for main battery and avionics power switches. These switches use two input pins on a board.

One of the **ON** positions is momentary and only stays on while it is held in position. They are often used as the APU switch in a Boeing 737. These switches use two input pins on a board.

### Tactile buttons

Say something about tactile buttons here, specifically the little black ones and the illuminated ones we all use for our custom PCBs.

## Other options

There are a near endless variety of buttons and switches available and all will work with MobiFlight. Choices include:

- ON-OFF toggle switches: These provide the same interaction as ON-ON switches but are less common.
