## Input configuration

{{< tabs items="On Press, On Release, On Hold, On Long Release" >}}

{{< tab >}}

The **On Press** event fires immediately after the button is pressed.

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab >}}

The **On Release** event fires when the button is released.

If **On Long Release** is configured, **On Release** will only fire when the button is released before the **Delay** specified in the **On Long Release** event.

{{< screenshot image="on-RELEASE.png" title="Screenshot of the button On Release event tab with the Action Type menu opened." >}}

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab >}}

The **On Hold** event fires while the button is held for longer than the millisecond count specified in the **Delay** field.

If the **repeat every** value is non-zero, the event will fire repeatedly at the specified millisecond interval until the button is released.

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab >}}

The **On Long Release** event fires when the button is released after being held for longer than the millisecond count specified in the **Delay** field, instead of the **On Release** event firing.
