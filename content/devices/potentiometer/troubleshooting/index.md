Potentiometers are generally reliable components, but slight variations between the different devices may cause problems when using standard events. This guide will help you troubleshoot common issues with potentiometers.

## Verify the potentiometer range

While most 10kÎ© linear potentiometers have a range of 0--1023, some may have a slightly different range. To verify the range of your potentiometer, [connect it to your board](/devices/potentiometer/wiring/), then take these steps.

### Enable logging

Follow the [logging guide](/guides/sharing-logs/) to enable info logging.

### Move the potentiometer

Move the potentiometer from one end to the other.

### Write down the values

The log will show the values from the potentiometer. Write down the minimum and maximum values from the log.

In the example below, the lowest value produced by the potentiometer is 13. The highest value, not shown, is 1023.

> [!TIP]
> Don't forget to disable logging after obtaining the potentiometer values. Logging can slow MobiFlight down during normal use.

## Adjust the event range

If the range of your potentiometer is different from the standard 0--1023, use the [HubHop potentiometer tool](https://hubhop.mobiflight.com/tools/) to generate the correct custom input event.

### Generate the event code

Set the **Device output range** preset to **Arduino** and enter the minimum and maximum values from the log. Set the **MSFS2020 event input range** to the desired input.

### Use the event code

The generated event code will be shown in the **Generated RPN code** box.

Copy and paste the code as the preset code when **Show Preset Code** is checked in the [input configuration dialog](/devices/potentiometer/configuring-device/).
