Potentiometers provide input values between a range when connected to an analog input on a board. They are often used for setting values like brightness, volume, flap position, elevator, rudder, trim, and throttle.

The most common potentiometers used with MobiFlight are 10kÎ© linear potentiometers, which provide a useful range of motion when combined with the 0--1023 steps available on most board analog inputs. Other devices that produce a variable voltage can also be used, such as Hall effect sensors.

## Other options

[Dual concentric potentiometers](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805208208523.html) integrate two potentiometers into a single shaft. They are useful for aircraft like the Cessna 172 where the glare shield and instrument light brightness is controlled with a single dial.
