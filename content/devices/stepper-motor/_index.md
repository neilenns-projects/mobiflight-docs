## Popular options

There is a wide range of stepper motors and driver boards available, most of which work with MobiFlight. A [28BYJ-48 small stepper motor with a ULN2003 driver](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=28BYJ-48) is a popular option to get started experimenting with stepper motors in a cockpit build.

## Other options

[x27](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=x27+stepper) stepper motors are also common. They are compact, and can be connected directly to a board without the need for a separate driver. When paired with a [AX1201728SG driver chip](https://www.aliexpress.us/w/wholesale-AX1201728SG.html), they are capable of fast and smooth movements.

[BKA30D-R5 dual-shaft stepper motors](https://www.aliexpress.us/w/wholesale-BKA30D%2525252dR5.html) are convenient for analog gauges with two needles, such the altitude gauge. They can be connected directly to a board without the need for a separate driver. When paired with a [AX1201728SG driver chip](https://www.aliexpress.us/w/wholesale-AX1201728SG.html), they are capable of fast and smooth movements.

The [TB6600 driver](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tb6600) is a common option for driving larger [Nema 17 stepper motors](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=nema+17+stepper+motor), like those found in 3D printers and small CNC machines.
