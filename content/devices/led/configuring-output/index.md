LEDs are typically mapped to simulator variables that output either `0` (for off) or `1` (for on). The following steps demonstrate how to use an LED to show the current state of an aircraft's parking brake in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024.

> [!TIP]
> The steps for using an LED with X-Plane are similar. Use the **X-Plane DataRef** type when configuring the **Sim Variable** tab.

### Close the dialog and try it out

Click the **OK** button to close the dialog, then spawn an airplane in Microsoft Flight Simulator.

Make sure the MobiFlight **Run** button is clicked in the toolbar, then try toggling the parking brake in the simulator. The attached LED should light up when the parking brake is applied.
