The following components are required for an output shift register or LED driver:

- The output shift register or LED driver chip.
- LEDs.
- Assorted resistors.
- 0.1uF capacitors.

Pay close attention to the orientation of the LEDs: the anode (long leg) should be connected to the chip and the cathode (short leg) should be connected to GND. This is the opposite of how LEDs are connected to LED driver chips. The 200Ω resistors are required on every output pin with an LED attached.

> [!TIP]
> Using a DM13A or other similar LED driver chip is a better choice than using the 74HC595 for driving LEDs.

Pay close attention to the orientation of the LEDs: the anode (long leg) should be connected to +5V and the cathode (short leg) should be connected to the chip. This is the opposite of how LEDs are connected to a 74HC595.

The value of $R_{\text{ext}}$ determines the amount of current for the LEDs. A 5kΩ resistor results in approximately 12mA per LED, a good brightness level for most situations.

> Connecting pin 21, {{% overline %}}EN{{% /overline %}}, to a PWM pin on a board enables brightness control of the LEDs as a group from MobiFlight.
