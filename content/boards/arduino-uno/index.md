The Arduino Uno R3 is an older design that doesn't offer many IO pins and has a large size.
Unless you already own one, we recommend purchasing a different board, either the
[Mega 2560 Pro Mini](/boards/mega-2560-pro-mini) if you need more IO pins (up to 70) or the
[Arduino Nano](/boards/arduino-nano) if space is at a premium.
