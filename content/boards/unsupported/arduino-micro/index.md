The Arduino Micro is an Arduino board based on the ATmega32U4 microcontroller.
While very similar to the [Pro Micro](/boards/pro-micro), it is a different board with different
features that cause incompatibilities.

While it is sometimes possible to install MobiFlight Pro Micro firmware on the Arduino Micro,
this should not be taken as a sign of support. The MobiFlight Pro Micro firmware was not designed
or tested with the Arduino Micro (non-pro) in mind, so attempting to use it on the Arduino Micro
board may lead to issues, including but not limited to missing pins.
