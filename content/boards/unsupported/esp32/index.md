> These boards are unsupported. Consider a [Raspberry Pi Pico 1](/boards/raspberry-pi-pico) instead.

While various boards with ESP32 chips are available as a pin-compatible replacement for other
microcontroller boards, the different architecture of the ESP32 processor requires a firmware
designed for the ESP32 platform. Since MobiFlight does not include an ESP32-compatible firmware,
boards using ESP32 chips are not supported.
