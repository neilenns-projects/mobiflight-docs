The Arduino Nano Every is an Arduino board based on the ATMega4809 microcontroller.
While it bears the Arduino Nano name and is prominently featured on the Arduino website as a successor
to the regular Arduino Nano, the fact that it uses a different microcontroller than the latter makes it
incompatible with MobiFlight firmware.
