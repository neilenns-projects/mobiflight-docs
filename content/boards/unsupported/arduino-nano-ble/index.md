The Arduino Nano 33 BLE is an Arduino board based on the nRF52840 wireless-enabled microcontroller.
While it bears the Arduino Nano name and is prominently featured on the Arduino website, the fact
that it uses a different microcontroller than the regular Arduino Nano makes it incompatible with
MobiFlight firmware.
