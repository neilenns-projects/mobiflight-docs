description: Details on MobiFlight support for the Arduino Mega 2560 Rev3
---

The Mega 2560 Rev3 is a classic Arduino board with a large number of IO pins and relatively low cost. Historically a popular board for MobiFlight projects, the newer [Arduino Mega 2560 Pro Mini](../arduino-mega-2560-pro-mini) is a better option for new projects.

> [!WARNING]
> Many lower-cost Arduino Mega 2560 Rev3 boards, particularly when purchased from AliExpress, use the CH340G chip
> for serial communication to the PC. These chips are frequently counterfeit and require
