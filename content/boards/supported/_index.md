These boards are supported but are older designs. If you already own one, they work fine. If you are
purchasing a new board, buy a [recommended board](/boards/recommended) instead.

> [!WARNING]
> Many boards have similar sounding names. Only the ones listed below are supported. See the
> [unsupported boards](/boards/unsupported) section for a list of boards that are often purchased by accident
> that will **not** work with MobiFlight.
