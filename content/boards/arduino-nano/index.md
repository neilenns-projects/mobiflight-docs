The Arduino Nano is a compact board that trades a smaller size for fewer IO pins than the Arduino Mega boards. It is a great choice when space is at a premium.

## Specifications

- 14 digital IO pins, 6 with PWM support.
- 8 analog inputs (can be used as digital inputs).

> [!WARNING]
> Many lower-cost Arduino Nano boards, particularly when purchased from AliExpress, use the CH340G chip for
> serial communication to the PC. These chips are frequently counterfeit and require
> [additional steps to make the boards work with MobiFlight](https://www.badcasserole.com/arduino-nano-with-ch340-chips-connection-issues/). Purchasing an Arduino Nano
> [from the MobiFlight Shop](https://shop.mobiflight.com/product/arduino-nano-usb-c) ensures
> you will get a board with genuine chips.
