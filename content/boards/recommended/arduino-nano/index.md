The Arduino Nano is a compact board that trades a smaller size for fewer IO pins than the Arduino Mega boards. It is a great choice when space is at a premium.

> [!WARNING]
> Many lower-cost Nano boards, particularly those purchased from AliExpress, use the CH340G chip for serial communication to the PC. These chips are frequently counterfeit and require [additional driver installation](/guides/installing-drivers/).
>
> Purchasing an Arduino Nano [from the MobiFlight Shop](https://shop.mobiflight.com/product/arduino-nano-usb-c) ensures you will get a board with genuine chips.

## Specifications

- 12 digital IO pins, 6 with PWM support (pins D0 and D1 cannot be used).
- 8 analog inputs (can be used as digital inputs, except for **A6** and **A7**).
