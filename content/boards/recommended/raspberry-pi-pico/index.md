> [!WARNING]
> MobiFlight only supports the Raspberry Pi Pico 1. The newer [Pico 2 board](/boards/unsupported/raspberry-pi-pico-2),
> with the RP2350 microcontroller, is not supported.

## Specifications

- 23 digital IO pins, 16 with PWM support.
- 3 analog inputs (can be used as digital IO pins).

> [!WARNING]
> The Raspberry Pi Pico 1 uses 3.3V for its digital signals and analog inputs. Certain output devices, including the MAX7219 7-segment LED driver chip and all LCDs, require 5V digital signals. If you plan to use those devices with the Pico, you will need to add a level shifter to your build. For analog devices like potentiometers, ensure they are powered with 3.3V rather than 5V to ensure accurate readings.
