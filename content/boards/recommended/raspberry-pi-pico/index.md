> [!WARNING]
> MobiFlight only supports the Raspberry Pi Pico 1. The newer [Pico 2 board](/boards/unsupported/raspberry-pi-pico-2),
> with the RP2350 microcontroller, is not supported.

## Specifications

- 23 digital IO pins, 16 with PWM support.
- 3 analog inputs (can be used as digital IO pins).

> [!WARNING]
> The Raspberry Pi Pico 1 uses 3.3V for its signals. This has the following implications:
>
> - Certain output devices, including the MAX7219 7-segment LED driver chip and all LCDs, require 5V digital signals. If you plan to use those devices with the Pico, you will need to add a level shifter to your build.
> - IO pins are not 5V-tolerant. To minimize the risk of damage to the microcontroller, run devices like input shift registers on a 3.3V power supply or use level shifters.
> - Analog inputs expect a voltage in the range from 0V--3.3V. Therefore, the positive end of a potentiometer should be connected to 3.3V, not 5V, to ensure reliability and accuracy.
